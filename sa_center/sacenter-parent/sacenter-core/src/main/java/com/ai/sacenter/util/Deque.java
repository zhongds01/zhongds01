/**
 * A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at
 * both ends.  The name <i>deque</i> is short for "double ended queue"
 * and is usually pronounced "deck".  Most <tt>Deque</tt>
 * implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements
 * they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted
 * deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines methods to access the elements at both
 * ends of the deque.  Methods are provided to insert, remove, and
 * examine the element.  Each of these methods exists in two forms:
 * one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
 * special value (either <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, depending on
 * the operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is
 * designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted
 *
 * <p>This interface extends the {@link Queue} interface.  When a deque is
 * used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.  Elements are
 * added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.  The methods
 * inherited from the <tt>Queue</tt> interface are precisely equivalent to
 * <tt>Deque</tt> methods as indicated in the following table:
 *
 * <p>Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.  This
 * interface should be used in preference to the legacy {@link Stack} class.
 * When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the
 * beginning of the deque.  Stack methods are precisely equivalent to
 * <tt>Deque</tt> methods as indicated in the table below:
